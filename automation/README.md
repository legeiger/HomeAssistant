### hvac.yaml Automations:
__[File Link](https://github.com/SilvrrGIT/HomeAssistant/blob/master/automation/thermostat.yaml)__

This set of automations is still in its infancy.  I replaced my nest thermostat with a basic Z-wave unit.  Given the presence detection of home assistant and the ability to control the thermostat, I can replace all the nest functions I used and have less reliance on 'the cloud'.

* Set the thermostat to 'away' temperature when everyone has left for the day. (weekdays only)
* Turn the thermostat back to our 'home' temperature at 4:00 to preheat the house so it is warm when my wife arrives home.
* If anyone comes home, turn the temperature back to the 'home' value.
* At bedtime lower the temperature 2 degrees.
* Pre-heat the house for when we wake up.

### Kuleddoubletap.yaml Automations:
__[File Link](https://github.com/SilvrrGIT/HomeAssistant/blob/master/automation/kuleddoubletap.yaml)__

* This is a simple automation to toggle our bedside lights when the 'kuled1' switch is double pressed.  The automation looks for the topic set by the double press and toggles the light when it sees it.  This required the following commands to be entered into the tasmota console on that switch. 

```
buttontopic kuledbutton
setoption1 1
setoption11 1
```
* This is an automation that upon double press of the switch evaluates if the LED strip in the room is on or off. If its off, the automation turns the LED strip on to a set color/brightness.  If its on, it starts a sequence to slowly turn off the LED strip overtime.  We use use this as a reading light when my son goes to bed at night.  When leaving the room we can double tap again and the light will slowly transition off.  This reuired the following commands to be entered into the tasmota console on that switch. 

```
buttontopic kuledbutton3
setoption1 1
setoption11 1
```

### Leaving Home.yaml Automations:

These notifications are triggered when I leave my home zone and no one is home.  These send a iOS app notification with an action option to turn the device off. These are primarily a power saving item and are the same framework as the bedtime notification as above. 
* Notify Me if the Desktop PC is left on and no one is home 
* Notify Me if the Media Center is left on and no one is home. This is an effort to automate my 'dumb'TV based on power usage.
